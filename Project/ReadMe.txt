Project Overview

This project explores the conversion and optimization of transformer neural network models to binary and multi-level representations, combined with parameter pruning. The aim is to reduce the model size and complexity, making it more efficient for deployment in environments with limited computational resources.

Key Components
Transformer Neural Networks:

Focuses on optimizing Transformer models, particularly those using self-attention mechanisms, for efficient deployment.
Transformer models, which leverage self-attention mechanisms, are ideal for tasks involving sequence data due to their ability to model long-range dependencies.
Optimization Techniques:

Binary and Multi-Level Quantization: Reduces the number of bits required to represent weights and activations, thus decreasing the model size and computational cost while attempting to maintain model accuracy.
Pruning: Removes less significant model parameters, allowing for a more compact and faster model by focusing computational resources on the most critical parts of the network.
Attention Mechanism in Transformers:

The self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence, dynamically weighting the importance of each element.
Multi-head self-attention enables the model to attend to different positions in the sequence simultaneously, enhancing the model's ability to capture various contextual relationships.

Project Steps:

Step 1: Implement different pruning methods to reduce the size of the Transformer model. These include techniques like top-k pruning, token-level pruning, and block-level pruning, each focusing on retaining the most critical model weights and inputs.
Step 2: Apply binary and multi-level quantization techniques to further compress the model. This involves converting weights and activations to binary or few-bit representations while maintaining model accuracy.
Step 3: Evaluate the performance of the pruned and quantized models. Measure accuracy, size, and computational efficiency, comparing different methods to find the optimal balance between model size and performance.
Performance Analysis:
